If you are sending small messages, often many at the same time, then it is very likely that it will be more efficient to leave Nagle enabled. A typical proper use of this flag is when you are sending what you know will be the last message sent for a while (e.g. the last in the server simulation tick to a particular client), and you use this flag to flush all messages.
